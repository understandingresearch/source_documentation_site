# Methodology
There are three general types of research methods (<a href="https://osf.io/4sdtm/" target="_blank" >watch our video</a>):

* [Quantitative](methodology/quantitative_research_en.md)
* [Qualitative](methodology/qualitative_research_en.md)
* [Mixed methods](methodology/mixed_methods_research_en.md)


[Participatory research](methodology/participatory_research_en.md) is an approach to research in which the communities or organizations that stand to benefit from the research collaborate as research partners. Any type of a research study can be participatory.
