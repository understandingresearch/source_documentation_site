## Literature reviews
Research is based on existing knowledge and is expected to fill knowledge gaps. Therefore, any research project begins with (is based on) a **literature review**. A literature review aims to summarize, combine, analyze, comment or critique existing publications on a given topic. 
Nowadays, literature reviews represent a large portion of the scientific literature published and consulted by the scientific and non-scientific community. Also, systematic reviews are used to enable decision-making based on the best available evidence. 


### Purpose of literature reviews

* ​Draw a portrait of a given topic
* Identify questions or aspects of the topic that require more research​ (knowledge gaps)
* Situate one’s work within existing literature​ (previous studies)
* Justify the relevance of a project and the research methodology employed
* Keep up to date on a given topic


### Main types of literature reviews
There are several types of literature reviews. The two main types are traditional and systematic.

| Traditional review | Systematic review |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Non-reproducible | Reproducible ​|
| | Transparent ​|
| | Explicit |
| No method | Clear and rigorous method |

Traditionally, the methods used to conduct literature reviews were not always very explicit. Such reviews were criticized for their lack of objectivity and scientific rigour. For example, only a few studies on a given topic are identified, the selection of studies seems arbitrary (without clear selection criteria), and the analysis of studies is influenced by the researcher's preconceptions. 

To increase scientific rigour, researchers have been interested in developing methods to make the review process more rigorous. In the "traditional" review there is generally no method described and therefore, it cannot be reproduced. Various terms are used to describe this type of review, for example, simply "literature review" or "critical review". 

At the other extreme, there is systematic review, which is one of the most rigorous types of review. Here, the method is clear and various strategies are used to increase scientific rigour. 

### Systematic review
A **systematic review** is a type of literature review that uses explicit and systematic methods to identify, select, evaluate and analyze studies in order to answer a specific review question.​ For example, researchers will search different databases and other sources to ensure that they find all the relevant studies. Also, there will be very clear selection criteria and two people (independent reviewers) will be involved in all stages of the review to avoid possible selection bias. 


Characteristics of a systematic review:

* tranparent
* reproducible
* explicit
* comprehensive

### Other types of reviews
| | |
| ------------- |-------------|
| **Rapid review** | Review produced for decision-makers that need an answer​ quickly; may simplify or omit certain steps of the systematic review ​ ​|
| **Review of reviews** | Review that analyzes multiple systematic reviews​ ​|
| **Scoping review** | Review that evaluates the extent of knowledge on a given topic, how much literature exists and the characteristics of that literature |

## How to read a research article
The volume of research articles is ever-growing and can be overwhelming. They can be organized in three big groups:

* Primary research: original studies
* Secondary research: literature reviews, secondary analysis
* Other: editorials, program descriptions, guidelines


Please <a href="https://osf.io/yqt3c/" target="_blank" >see our video</a> about how to read a research article.

To recognize research articles, you can look for format and characteristics unique to research. Typically, research articles have the following sections and subsections: 

| Beginning | Body | End |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Title | Introduction | Conclusion |
| Authors | Methods | References |
| Abstract | Results | Funding |
| Keywords | Discussion | |

### Components of a research article
In the following table, each component of an article is explained:

| Component | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Title** | What the article is about. It may include the word “research” or specific study design to help you identify if the article is reporting empirical research. For example, some titles will tell you right away the nature of the study (e.g., a systematic review). |
| **Authors** | Includes the authors' names and their institutions (e.g., universities or hospitals).|
| **Name of the journal** | Allows you to verify whether the journal is peer-reviewed, which usually ensures conceptual and methodological quality. |
| **Date of publication** | Allows you to identify research currency, as more current research may be more relevant. |
| **Abstract** | Summary of the article. The abstract helps you determine whether to read the entire article or not, and are often available for free online. Most scientific journals have a structured abstract with headings (i.e., introduction, methods, results, conclusions). Non-research articles may have an abstract, but will not discuss the research process.  |
| **Keywords** | Terms that describe the article. They are provided by the authors, or added by librarians or automatically (computer indexing).  You can use these to find related articles. |
| **Introduction** | Describes the problem the authors are trying to solve. This section will usually conclude with the specific research questions. |
| **Methods** | Describes what the authors did: the study design, when, where and how they collected the data, ethics committee approval, and how the data was analyzed. |
| **Results** | Focuses on what the results are and not what they mean. The first part of the Results section will often describe the participants (how many and who they were). |
| **Discussion** | Includes the interpretation of the results and implications of the study. The authors may connect their findings to earlier work, discuss unexpected findings, study limitations and strengths. |
| **Conclusion** | Closes the article, provides overall conclusions and ideas for future research. |
| **References** | Citations of sources used by authors, and can help you identify related studies. |
| **Funding information** | Identifies who funded the study and helps to identify potential conflict of interest. |

Reading an article may take a very long time at first and require reading it many times. As you read, take notes and read critically – do not assume the authors are always correct. Finally, there are different approaches to reading research articles. Some say do not read the abstract; others say to read the title, abstract, and conclusions first. Try different approaches and see what works for you.
