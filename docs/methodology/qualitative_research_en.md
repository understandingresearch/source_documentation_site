# Qualitative research

## When to use qualitative research
Qualitative research is not used instead of quantitative research. It allows us to answer questions that cannot be answered in the same way through quantitative research. Qualitative data are collected by speaking to people, by observing people and situations, and systematically recording our observations (taking notes, photographs, videos, etc). In this way, qualitative research allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of a phenomenon.

| | Is | Is not|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Objective | To understand a phenomenon | To measure a phenomenon |
| Questions | What? How? Why? | How many? Questions with yes/no answers |
| Data | Words, images, sound(s), interviews, observations | Numbers, questionnaires, survey, documents |

## Qualitative data collection
Qualitative data are collected in three main ways:

* **Interviews:** We speak with people either individually or in groups, record our interviews and transcribe them. These transcriptions are the data we analyse.
* **Observations:** We observe people and situations, and systematically record these observations through note taking, photographs, sketches, or videos.
* **Documents:** We collect documents, such as emails, reports, meeting minutes, or any other document that provides information to help us answer our questions.

## Transferability
Qualitative research results are not being generalized to larger populations. This is not possible because, among other things, the samples are generally small. The richness of qualitative research is in the level of detail; the depth of the results. 

Transferability is the qualitative “equivalent” of generalizability. The objective is to present the results with enough details for the reader to see if they are transferable in their context.

## Perspectives and dimensions
Not everyone understands or perceives a phenomenon the same way. Qualitative research allows us to examine the different perceptions of those experiencing the phenomenon from different perspectives.

## Frames of reference
When we report the results of a qualitative study, one goal is to make sure our audience understands the phenomenon in the way we intend. The frame of reference we use to analyse and describe a phenomenon can alter the way our audience perceives it.
Qualitative research allows us to understand phenomena in different ways.

## Construction and deconstruction
To understand a phenomenon in qualitative research, we may break it apart into its many "pieces" and fit the "pieces" back together in new ways. For instance, in a qualitative study we tease apart transcriptions of interviews into discreet categories. This data analysis process is referred to as "coding".
