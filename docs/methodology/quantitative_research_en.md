# Quantitative research

## When to use quantitative research
**Quantitative research is useful for studying measurable phenomena.** It tries to explain phenomena by collecting data, and analyze them using mathematical methods, especially statistics.  

In health research, quantitative research can answer questions such as:

* How many cases of a disease exist in a population?
* What proportion of people with a disease survives 5 years after the diagnosis? 
* Does a new treatment decrease the symptoms of a disease compared to the traditional treatment?

## Goals of quantitative research

The central goal of quantitative research is the generalization of findings. It is often impossible to study a whole population. Generally, we will study a representative sample of that population. Generalization means that the researchers will extend the results founds from a sample to the whole population. 

Quantitative research also allows to study hypotheses using statistical tests. For example, a researcher can be interested in comparing the following two hypotheses: 

* The influenza vaccine reduces the number of hospitalizations per year, and 
* The influenza vaccine does not reduce the number of hospitalizations per year

To test these hypotheses, a quantitative study can be performed to compare the number of elderly people hospitalized among those who have been vaccinated and those who have not been vaccinated. Statistical tests are used to compare the groups, which consider the sample size and variability of the observed results. It will tell us the probability that the observed results are due to chance or not. 

It is very important to note that it is always possible to obtain incorrect "results" in quantitative research. A methodological error can very easily lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus, rigour of the methods is particularly important.

## Types of quantitative health research

| Field | Study | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Biomedical science | To study living organisms, their responses to disease processes and therapies | Does the new antibiotic kill more germs than the old one? |
| Clinical research | To study the efficacy and safety of treatments and diagnostic products | Does the new antibiotic treat a disease faster compared to traditional treatment? |
| Public health research | To study disease prevention and health promotion | Does the use of the new antibiotic reduce the number of hospitalizations? |
| Health services research | To answer health services questions | Did doctors prescribe the new antibiotic to patients in need? |

## Study designs

There are two general types of study designs within quantitative methods:

* Experimental
* Observational

Within these, there are several subtypes.

| Type | Study design | Example |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Experimental | Randomized controlled trial | Researchers determine, through a controlled process, the exposure for each individual (clinical trial) or community (community trial), and then track the individuals or communities over time to detect the effects of the exposure; participants are allocated at random to the intervention or control groups |
| Observational | Cohort (longitudinal) | Researchers record whether each study subject is exposed or not, and then track the subjects to see if they develop the disease being studied |
| | Case-control study | Researchers enroll a group of people with the disease (cases) and a group without the disease (controls), then compare previous exposures to different factors between the two groups  |
| | Cross-sectional study | Researchers enroll a sample of people from a population and their exposures and health outcomes are measured simultaneously at a specific point in time |
| | Ecological (population-based) | Researchers measure disease rates and different determinants for each unit (each population), and the relationships between disease rates and determinants are examined |

## Statistics in health research
The observations of the studies are expressed in quantifiable data. Statistics is the analysis and interpretation of quantifiable data. 

**Biostatistics** is the science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities “for addressing, analyzing and solving problems in public health; health care; and biomedical, clinical and population-based research” (Calhoun, Ramiah, Weist, Shortell, 2008).

Two types of statistics are often used in health research:

* Descriptive statistics
* Inferential statistics

**Descriptive statistics** describes, organizes, summarizes and presents variables and numerical data. They do not allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data. Descriptive statistics are very important because it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing if we simply presented our raw data, especially if there was a lot of it. Therefore, descriptive statistics enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data.

**Inferential statistics** are techniques that allow us to use results from samples to make generalizations about the populations from which the samples were drawn. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately represents the population. 


## Big data and health research
Whereas statisticians and early data scientists were often limited to working with “sample” sets of data, big data has enabled data scientists to access and work with massive sets of data without restriction. Big data has caused the scientific community to re-examine its methodology of scientific research and has triggered a revolution in scientific thinking and methods. Rather than relying on representative data samples, data scientists can now rely on the data itself, in all of its granularity, nuance, and detail. 

For example, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used to study big data. Although many artificial intelligence technologies have existed for several decades, only now are they able to take advantage of datasets of sufficient size to provide meaningful learning and results. The ability to access large volumes of data with agility and ready access is leading to a rapid evolution in the application of artificial intelligence and machine-learning applications.
