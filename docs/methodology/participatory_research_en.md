# Participatory research

## What is participatory research

“Systematic inquiry, with the collaboration of those affected by the issue being studied, for the purpose of education and taking action or effecting social change.”(Green et al. 1995)

There are 4 things to retain in this definition:

1. Participatory research involves a partnership among the academic researchers and the people who will either be affected by the results or who will need to use the results.
2. Participatory research is research and it can use quantitative methods, qualitative methods or mixed methods
3. There is always an element of learning. All the stakeholders learn something throughout the research process, often from each other.
4. Participatory research involves action. We do not undertake participatory research just for the sake of learning something. We do it because we want to create a change. For instance in organizational participatory research we aim to create practice changes, like for example, improving dementia care access.

## What differentiates participatory research
The stakeholders in the partnership must **make decisions together** in at least these four stages of the research process:

* Research focus
* Data collection and/or analysis
* Interpretation of results
* Dissemination and/or implementation
 
**Overall, we undertake participatory research because we want to make a change and partnering with a varied group of stakeholders can help ensure our work is relevant and used.**
