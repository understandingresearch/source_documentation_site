## What is knowledge translation
**Knowledge translation** (KT) is the step of sharing research findings. KT is a term used to describe the activities involved in "moving" knowledge developed through research to people and organizations who can use it in real-world settings.

* Publication of scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals, etc.
* Planing, performing and sustaining multiple outreach activities (for example on social media)

### Dissemination to a targeted audience
* User guides for potential users
* Webinars (online seminars) to briefly describe a new tool and demonstrate its use
